                                      //TIME COMPLEXITY Analysis
According to me,the time complexity will be like : 2M(for merging last 2 lists) + 3M(for merging last 2 combined and last 3rd) + 4M + ... + NM, taking M common,  M(2+3+....N) , which is approximately, M(N)(N+1)/2 = O(M*N^2).

You have a valid point regarding the time complexity analysis. Let's re-evaluate the time complexity step-by-step using your perspective.

Detailed Analysis
Recursive Calls and Merging:
The flat function recursively calls itself on the next node and then merges the current node's list with the already flattened next node list.
For each recursive call, the size of the sublist increases as we merge progressively larger lists.
Merging Process
For 𝑁 nodes with each node potentially having 𝑀 child nodes:

Last Merge:

Merging the last two lists involves approximately 𝑀 operations.
Second Last Merge:

Merging the result with the third last list involves approximately 2M operations.
Third Last Merge:

Merging the result with the fourth last list involves approximately 3M operations.
General Case:

Merging at the i-th step involves approximately iM operations.
Summation of Merging Costs
The total merging cost can be written as:

M(2+3+4+…+N)
The sum of the first  natural numbers starting from 2 is:

2+3+4+…+N= 
N(N+1)/2
 −1
Multiplying this sum by M, we get:

𝑀(𝑁(𝑁+1)/2−1)

Since the −1 is insignificant in Big-O notation, we approximate it to:
 M⋅ N(N+1)/2=MN^2/2+MN/2


Ignoring constant factors and lower-order terms, the dominant term is:
O(MN^2)
Conclusion
Your analysis is correct: the time complexity for flattening the multi-level linked list is indeed O(MN^2), where 
𝑁 is the number of nodes in the main list, and 
𝑀 is the maximum number of child nodes any node can have.

Final Time Complexity
The overall time complexity for the flattening process, considering the merging cost at each step, is:
O(MN^2)
This matches your understanding. Great job!
