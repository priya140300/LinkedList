 tell me whether i understood correctly?"We are adding k+1 nodes to the heap because as the doubly ll is k sorted it means the element is k positions away so there should be k+1 elements in order to provide any element to move k elements  if it is k places away?

Yes, you understood it correctly. Let's elaborate on this understanding to ensure complete clarity:

Detailed Explanation
k-Sorted List Property:

In a k-sorted doubly linked list, each element is at most k positions away from its target position in the sorted list.
This means any given element in the list can be out of its sorted position by at most k places forward or backward.
Using a Min-Heap:

A min-heap helps efficiently find and place the smallest element among a group of elements.
By maintaining a min-heap of size k+1, we ensure that we are always considering all possible candidates for the smallest element within the current window of size k+1.
Why k+1 Elements:

To ensure that every element within its k positions from its target position is considered, we add k+1 elements to the heap.
For any position in the list, the smallest element that should be at that position can be at most k positions ahead. Therefore, we need to consider up to k+1 elements to account for this.
Illustration with an Example
Let's assume a doubly linked list is k-sorted, and k = 2:

Initial List: 4 <-> 3 <-> 2 <-> 6 <-> 5 <-> 8
In this example:

The element 4 can be at index 0, 1, or 2.
The element 3 can be at index 0, 1, or 2.
The element 2 can be at index 0, 1, or 2.


-=======================================================================================
time taken to insert a element into min heap is logk ;so inserting n elements will take nlogk;since in the code we are removing total elements one by one ;so this also is nlogk so total tc is nlogk+nlogk =2nlogk ;2 is constant so can be ignored so therefore tc is O(nlogk)
===========================================================================================
Yes, that's correct. Since the min-heap will store at most k+1 elements at any given time, the space complexity for the heap is O(k). Here's a summary:
Space Complexity: O(k) for the min-heap, which stores at most k+1 elements.
Therefore, the overall space complexity of the algorithm is O(k).
======================================================================================
The issue of running into an infinite loop during printing is due to not properly terminating the list after sorting. Let's break down why setting curr.next = null is crucial.

Why curr.next = null is Important
When sorting the doubly linked list using the min-heap, the list nodes are reordered. If the last node's next pointer is not set to null, the list can become cyclic or incorrectly linked, causing an infinite loop during traversal.

Problem Without curr.next = null
If we don't set curr.next = null, the last node's next pointer might still point to a node in the original list, leading to incorrect traversal and potential infinite loops.
